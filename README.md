Group 2 project 1 for GW DA boot

The Proposal is 'Group 2 proposal.txt'
The relevant information in our final writeup is in 'Group 2 Writeup.docx'
The presentation is in 'Group 2 presentation.pptx'
The images are throughout the root directory
The 2 relevant notebooks are 'HealthyAmericas - Xin final.ipynb' and 'Food Atlas Processor.ipynb'
Additionally, there is a generic python file that uses tkinter to pop up a gui to allow comparison between different columns of the food atlas across the US
There is an R file for some of the statistical computations we had done separately.

In order to run the notebooks, 3 additional datasets are needed (not included due to size/license):
	Food atlas 2015 can be found at:
